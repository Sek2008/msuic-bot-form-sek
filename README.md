### âš¡ Installation

Well, let's start by downloading the code.
Go to the folder `config` then the file `bot.json`.
For the bot to be able to start, please complete the file with your credentials as follows :

```js
{
    "game": "GAME",
    "prefix": "PREFIX",
    "token_bot": "TOKEN"
}
```

Reminder :

- `game`, the status of the bot.
- `prefix`, the prefix that will be set to use the bot.
- `token_bot`, the token of the bot available on the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) section.

To customize the emojis go to the file `emojis.json`.
Emojis are already defined by default but you can modify them if you wish.

```js
{
    "music": ":musical_note:",
    "queue": ":bar_chart:",
    "error": ":x:",
    "success": ":white_check_mark:"
}
```

In the console, type `npm install` to install all dependencies.

To start the bot :

```
#With Node
node index.js

#With pm2
pm2 start index.js --name "MusicBot"
```

All you have to do is turn on your bot !
